-- District recovery — Migration 2 of 3: wire district_recovery into v2 as a COALESCE FALLBACK.
-- Only fills district_ar where the native path (v1) has none; NEVER overrides an existing district.
-- Only branch 1 (the v1-fed branch) changes: district_ar -> COALESCE(v1.district_ar, dr.district_ar) + LEFT JOIN.
-- NOTE: this is the body as applied by THIS change (property_age from ea.*). A later, separate migration
-- (age registry producer) redefines v2 to source property_age from listing_age_resolved while preserving
-- this COALESCE — replaying in version order reproduces the live state. Always build a new v2 migration from
-- the CURRENT LIVE body (pg_get_viewdef), never from an older file, to avoid dropping a sibling clause.
