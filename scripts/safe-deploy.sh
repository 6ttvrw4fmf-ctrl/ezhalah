# Pre-deploy safety guard — added 2026-07-09 after a P0 incident where uncommitted/unpushed local
# UI work was live via `vercel --prod` from a dirty tree, then silently lost when a later deploy
# ran from a clean `main` checkout that never had it. See docs/DEPLOY_SAFETY.md for the full story.
#
# Usage: scripts/safe-deploy.sh
#
# Refuses to deploy unless: on `main`, HEAD == origin/main exactly, and the working tree is
# completely clean. This is the ONLY way this repo should be deployed to production from now on —
# never run `vercel --prod` directly.
